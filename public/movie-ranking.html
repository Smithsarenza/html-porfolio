<h3>Classroom of the Elite</h3>
<p>
  In the not too distant future, the Japanese government has established the
  Tokyo Metropolitan Advanced Nurturing High School, dedicated to instruct and
  foster the generation of people that will support the country in the future.
  The students there have the freedom to wear any hairstyle and bring any
  personal effects they desire. Our protagonist is Kiyotaka Ayanokōji, a quiet,
  unassuming boy who is not good at making friends and would rather keep his
  distance. He is a student of D-Class, which is where the school dumps its
  inferior students in order to ridicule them. After meeting Suzune Horikita and
  Kikyō Kushida, two other students in his class, Kiyotaka's situation begins to
  change.
